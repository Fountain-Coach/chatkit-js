Widgets let you display context, shortcuts, and interactive cards right inside the conversation.

When a user interacts with a widget that has a client-side action handler, ChatKit calls the handler you provided through widgets.onAction.

## Handle actions on the client

Use the `onAction` callback from `WidgetsOption` (or the equivalent React hook) to capture widget events. Forward the action payload to your backend so it can take the appropriate side effect.

```ts
chatkit.setOptions({
  widgets: {
    async onAction(action, item) {
      if (action.type === 'refresh-dashboard') {
        // handle client-side state
        store.setState({ refreshing: true });

        // and/or send the action to your server
        await fetch('your/api/refresh-dashboard', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
          body: JSON.stringify({ page: action.payload.page, itemId: item.id }),
        });
      }
       
      // ..handle other actions
    },
  },
});
```

Looking for a full server example? The [ChatKit Python SDK docs](https://openai.github.io/chatkit-python-sdk/guides/widget-actions) include an end-to-end walkthrough that mirrors the JS API.

## Design widgets quickly

Use the [Widget Studio](https://widgets.chatkit.studio/) to experiment with card layouts, list rows, and preview components. When you are satisfied, copy the generated JSON into your integration and serve it from your backend.
